# hello-world
This is my first Github repository.

Greetings,

I am Blade Marcantel, and I am writing this in the year 2016. In fact, it's the last day of 2016. Soon, a new world opens up and here's to hoping 2017 is far better than 2016. I'm hoping by 2018, I'll fully understand web development and programming languages well enough to have used GitHub very frequently and built up a solid sample portfolio.

Hopefully, once 2018 rolls around, I can find a new, challenging career in web development along with more money to survive the future to come.
